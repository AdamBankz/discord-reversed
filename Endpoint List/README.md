# Important Endpoints



### `https://discord.com/api/v9/unique-username/username-suggestions-unauthed?global_name=` <br>
**Although this endpoint is supposed to suggest unused usernames, it can also be used to check whether a username is available or not.**


```py

response = requests.get("https://discord.com/api/v9/unique-username/username-suggestions-unauthed?global_name=adam")
print(response.text)
```
**The following code will return the username `adam` with 4 random integers at the end as the username `adam` is taken.**
```py
{"username":"adam0219"}
```
**If it isn't taken, then it will return the original `global_name` parameter we inserted into the URL. If `adam` was not taken, it would return this:**
```py
{"username":"adam"}
```
# 
### `https://discord.com/api/v9/auth/register` <br>

**Unfortunately, Discord is very aggressive with CAPTCHAs, instead of attempting bot detection, they push a CAPTCHA for every registration.
I was planning to reverse engineer their private mobile API on their mobile application as I believed there would be less or no CAPTCHAs there, but they use the same method over there.** ‚ùå

If a hCaptcha solver is ever released for hCaptcha Enterprise, `a9b5fb07-92ff-493f-86fe-352a2803b3df` is Discord's sitekey, which you can use for solving the CAPTCHAs and bypassing them.
